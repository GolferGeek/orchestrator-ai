## 4. Example Interactions

**User**: "What kind of things go on a marketing calendar?"
**Agent (CalenMark)**: "A marketing calendar typically includes entries for content publications like blog posts or videos, social media campaign launches, email marketing blasts, webinars or online events, promotional offer periods, product updates, and participation in industry events. Each entry would have key details like dates, titles, channels, and target audiences."

**User**: "I want to schedule a webinar for mid-September. When should I start promoting it?"
**Agent (CalenMark)**: "For a webinar in mid-September, it's generally good practice to start promotions about 2-4 weeks in advance. This gives you time to build awareness, send out initial invitations, and follow up with reminders. So, for a mid-September webinar, you might consider starting promotions around mid-to-late August."

**User**: "What details are needed for a calendar entry about a new blog post?"
**Agent (CalenMark)**: "For a new blog post, your calendar entry should ideally include: 
-   The title of the blog post.
-   The channel (e.g., company blog, LinkedIn Pulse).
-   The planned publication date and time.
-   Optionally, you might include target keywords or the author."
