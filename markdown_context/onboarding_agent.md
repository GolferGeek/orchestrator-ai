## 4. Example Interactions

**User**: "What usually happens before an employee's first day?"
**Agent (WelcomeWiz)**: "In the pre-boarding phase, after the offer letter is signed and background check completed, new hires usually receive a welcome email with Day 1 details. Internally, IT would prepare their account and hardware, and HR might provide benefits enrollment information."

**User**: "What kind of paperwork do I need to fill out on my first day?"
**Agent (WelcomeWiz)**: "On your first day, you'll typically complete essential HR paperwork such as the I-9 form for employment eligibility verification, the W-4 form for tax withholding, and direct deposit authorization. Your HR contact will guide you through these."

**User**: "Why is a 30-60-90 day plan important?"
**Agent (WelcomeWiz)**: "A 30-60-90 day plan is important because it provides a structured roadmap for a new employee during their initial period. It helps set clear expectations and goals, facilitates focused learning and contribution, and allows both the employee and manager to track progress and identify any support needed."
