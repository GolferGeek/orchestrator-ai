Configure status bar appearance for iOS using Capacitor's StatusBar plugin:\n   ```typescript\n   import { StatusBar, Style } from '@capacitor/status-bar';\n\n   // In app initialization\n   StatusBar.setStyle({ style: Style.Light }); // or Dark\n   StatusBar.setBackgroundColor({ color: '#ffffff' });\n   ```\n2. Handle safe areas for notched devices (iPhone X and newer):\n   ```scss\n   ion-content {\n     --padding-top: var(--ion-safe-area-top);\n     --padding-bottom: var(--ion-safe-area-bottom);\n   }\n   ```\n3. Configure splash screen appearance in capacitor.config.ts\n4. Ensure proper status bar color transitions between different app screens\n5. Test and adjust content positioning to respect device notches and home indicators\n\nTesting approach:\n- Test on devices with notches (iPhone X or newer)\n- Verify status bar appearance matches app theme\n- Ensure content respects safe areas and doesn't appear under notches or home indicators\n- Check splash screen appearance and transitions",
