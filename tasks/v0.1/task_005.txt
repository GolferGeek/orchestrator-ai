# Task ID: 5
# Title: Chat Input and Message Submission
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the text input field and message submission functionality
# Details:
Create a ChatInput component with a text field and send button. Use Ionic's IonInput and IonButton components. Implement form submission handling that dispatches actions to the Pinia store. Add validation to prevent empty message submission. Implement keyboard event handlers (Enter key for submission). Connect the input to the messages store to add user messages to the conversation thread. Clear the input field after submission. Add loading indicators during message processing.

# Test Strategy:
Test message submission with various inputs. Verify the input field clears after submission. Test keyboard navigation and Enter key submission. Confirm messages appear in the chat thread after submission. Test validation to ensure empty messages cannot be submitted.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create ChatInput Component with Ionic UI Elements [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build the basic ChatInput component with text field and send button using Ionic components
### Details:
1. Create a new ChatInput.vue component
2. Import IonInput, IonButton, and other necessary Ionic components
3. Implement the component template with an IonInput for text entry and an IonButton with a send icon
4. Add basic styling to match the app's design system
5. Set up reactive data property for the message text using ref()
6. Ensure the component is responsive for different screen sizes
7. Test the basic rendering of the component in isolation

## 2. Implement Form Submission and Validation [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Add form handling with validation and keyboard event listeners
### Details:
1. Wrap the input elements in a form element
2. Create a submitMessage() method that validates input before submission
3. Add validation to prevent empty message submission (trim the input and check length)
4. Implement keyboard event handler for Enter key to submit the message
5. Add visual feedback for validation errors if needed
6. Add a computed property to determine if the submit button should be disabled
7. Test the validation logic with different input scenarios (empty, whitespace-only, valid messages)

## 3. Integrate with Pinia Store for Message Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Connect the ChatInput component to the Pinia store for message submission
### Details:
1. Import and use the messages store from Pinia
2. Modify the submitMessage() method to dispatch an action to the store (e.g., addMessage or sendMessage)
3. Pass the message text and any necessary metadata to the store
4. Clear the input field after successful submission
5. Implement proper error handling for failed submissions
6. Test the integration with the store by verifying messages appear in the conversation thread
7. Ensure the component correctly resets after submission

## 4. Add Loading State Indicators [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement loading indicators and UI state management during message processing
### Details:
1. Add a loading state reactive property to the component
2. Update the UI to show a loading indicator when a message is being processed
3. Disable the input field and send button during the loading state
4. Modify the store integration to properly handle loading states (start loading before dispatch, end after response)
5. Add a subtle animation or spinner to the send button during processing
6. Implement error handling to reset loading state if message submission fails
7. Test the loading state transitions with both quick and delayed responses
