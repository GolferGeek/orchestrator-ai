# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Frontend Authentication UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create user interface components for signup, login, and logout functionality.
# Details:
1. Create login form component with email and password fields
2. Create signup form with email, password, and optional display name
3. Implement form validation for both forms
4. Create authentication service to interact with backend auth endpoints
5. Store JWT token in localStorage and attach to API requests
6. Add logout functionality that clears stored tokens
7. Create protected route wrapper to redirect unauthenticated users
8. Display current user information when logged in

# Test Strategy:
Test the authentication flow manually. Verify form validation works correctly. Test that protected routes redirect unauthenticated users. Verify that the JWT token is correctly stored and used for API requests.
