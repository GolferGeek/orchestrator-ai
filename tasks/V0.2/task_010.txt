# Task ID: 10
# Title: Integrate Frontend with Supabase-backed Chat API
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update the frontend chat interface to work with the new session-based backend API.
# Details:
1. Update the chat service to send session_id with chat requests
2. Modify the chat interface to load existing messages when a session is selected
3. Ensure new messages are correctly added to the current session
4. Update the UI to show loading states during API calls
5. Implement error handling for failed API requests
6. Add automatic session creation for new chats
7. Ensure the chat context is maintained when switching between sessions

# Test Strategy:
Test the complete flow from login to session selection to chat interaction. Verify that chat history is correctly loaded and maintained. Test switching between sessions and creating new sessions. Verify that the conversation context is preserved across page reloads.
