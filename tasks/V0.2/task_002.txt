# Task ID: 2
# Title: Set Up Supabase Schema Management Workflow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Establish the migration workflow and directory structure for managing Supabase database schema changes.
# Details:
1. Create `/supabase/migrations/` directory at project root
2. Create initial migration SQL file for database schema
3. Add NPM scripts to `package.json` for Supabase CLI operations:
   - `supabase:login`
   - `supabase:link`
   - `supabase:migrate:up`
   - `supabase:db:pull`
4. Document the workflow for creating and applying migrations in README.md
5. Test the linking process with the remote Supabase project

# Test Strategy:
Manually test each NPM script to ensure it works correctly. Verify that migrations can be applied to the remote Supabase project and that schema changes are reflected.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Directory Structure for Supabase Migrations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the necessary directory structure for managing Supabase database migrations at the project root
### Details:
1. Create a `/supabase/` directory at the project root
2. Create a `/supabase/migrations/` subdirectory for SQL migration files
3. Create a `.gitignore` file in the `/supabase/` directory to exclude sensitive configuration files
4. Add a placeholder `.keep` file in the migrations directory to ensure it's tracked by git
5. Test by verifying the directory structure exists and is properly tracked in git

## 2. Create Initial Database Schema Migration [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the first migration SQL file that defines the initial database schema
### Details:
1. Create a timestamped migration file in the format `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_initial_schema.sql` in the `/supabase/migrations/` directory
2. Define the initial database schema including tables, relationships, and indexes
3. Include appropriate comments in the SQL file to document the purpose of each table and column
4. Add `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"` if UUID functionality is needed
5. Test the migration SQL file syntax using a SQL linter or validator to ensure it's error-free

## 3. Configure Supabase CLI and NPM Scripts [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Set up the Supabase CLI and add NPM scripts to package.json for common operations
### Details:
1. Install Supabase CLI globally or as a dev dependency: `npm install @supabase/cli --save-dev`
2. Add the following NPM scripts to `package.json`:
   - `"supabase:login": "supabase login"`
   - `"supabase:link": "supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF"`
   - `"supabase:migrate:up": "supabase db push"`
   - `"supabase:db:pull": "supabase db pull"`
3. Create a `.env.example` file showing required environment variables
4. Test the scripts by running `npm run supabase:login` to verify CLI is properly installed

## 4. Document Migration Workflow in README.md [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the migration workflow in the project README
### Details:
1. Add a 'Database Migrations' section to the README.md
2. Document the initial setup process for developers
3. Detail the workflow for:
   - Creating new migrations
   - Applying migrations to local development environment
   - Applying migrations to production
   - Handling migration conflicts
4. Include example commands and expected outputs
5. Add troubleshooting tips for common issues
6. Test by having another team member follow the documentation to verify it's clear and accurate

## 5. Test Remote Supabase Project Linkage [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Verify that the local development environment can properly link with the remote Supabase project
### Details:
1. Ensure you have the Supabase project reference ID from the Supabase dashboard
2. Run `npm run supabase:login` to authenticate with Supabase
3. Run `npm run supabase:link` to link to the remote project
4. Test applying migrations with `npm run supabase:migrate:up`
5. Verify changes are reflected in the Supabase dashboard
6. Test pulling the schema with `npm run supabase:db:pull` and verify it matches expected structure
7. Document any issues encountered and their solutions in the README.md
