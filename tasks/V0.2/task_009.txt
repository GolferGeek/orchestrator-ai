# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Frontend Session Management UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create user interface components for viewing and managing chat sessions.
# Details:
1. Create a sidebar component to display the user's chat sessions
2. Implement UI for creating a new chat session
3. Allow users to select a past session to continue the conversation
4. Update the chat interface to show messages from the selected session
5. Create a service to interact with the session management endpoints
6. Add loading states and error handling for session operations
7. Implement session name editing functionality

# Test Strategy:
Test the session management UI manually. Verify that sessions are correctly displayed and can be selected. Test creating new sessions and continuing conversations in existing sessions. Verify that error states are handled correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Session Management Service [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a service layer to interact with session management API endpoints
### Details:
Create a SessionService class that handles all API interactions for sessions. Implement methods for: fetchSessions(), createSession(), getSessionById(), updateSessionName(), and deleteSession(). Include appropriate error handling and response parsing. The service should use the existing HTTP client and maintain consistent error handling patterns. Test each method with mock API responses to ensure proper data transformation and error handling.

## 2. Implement Session Sidebar Component [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a sidebar component to display and interact with chat sessions
### Details:
Create a SessionSidebar component that displays a list of user sessions. Include a 'New Chat' button at the top. Each session item should display the session name with an overflow menu for actions (rename, delete). Implement click handlers to select a session. Add appropriate styling for active/selected sessions. Use the SessionService to fetch sessions on component mount. Include empty state and loading indicators. Test the component rendering with various session lists and interaction behaviors.

## 3. Add Session Creation and Selection Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement functionality to create new sessions and select existing ones
### Details:
Enhance the SessionSidebar to handle new session creation. Implement a click handler for the 'New Chat' button that calls SessionService.createSession(). Add state management to track the currently selected session. When a session is selected, store the active session ID in state and highlight the selected session in the UI. Implement a central state management approach (Context API or state management library) to share the active session across components. Test session creation flow and selection behavior.

## 4. Update Chat Interface for Session Messages [done]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Modify the chat interface to display messages from the selected session
### Details:
Update the main chat component to load and display messages based on the selected session. Connect to the session state management to react to session changes. When a session is selected, fetch messages for that session using the SessionService. Clear the message area when creating a new session. Implement scroll behavior to show the most recent messages. Add loading states while fetching messages. Test the component with various session scenarios including empty sessions, long message histories, and session switching.

## 5. Implement Session Editing and Error Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Add functionality to edit session names and handle error states
### Details:
Implement session name editing functionality in the SessionSidebar. Create an inline edit component for session names. When a user selects 'Rename' from the session menu, display an editable field with the current name. Save changes using SessionService.updateSessionName(). Add comprehensive error handling throughout the session UI components. Create reusable error display components. Implement toast notifications for success/error feedback. Add retry mechanisms for failed operations. Test error scenarios by mocking API failures and validating the error handling behavior.
