# Phase III: Orchestrator-First Frontend - PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Phase III frontend of the Agent Framework. The primary goal is to build an orchestrator-centric user interface using Ionic and Vue 3, ensuring a consistent experience across web and mobile platforms (with an initial focus on iPhone compatibility via Capacitor).

## 2. Goals

-   **Orchestrator-First Interaction**: The user's primary interaction point will be with the Orchestrator agent through a chat-like interface.
-   **Cross-Platform Support**: Develop a responsive UI that functions seamlessly on web browsers and can be compiled into a native mobile application (targeting iOS initially).
-   **Intuitive User Experience**: Provide a clean, modern, and easy-to-use interface for interacting with the agent ecosystem.
-   **Core Functionality**: Implement essential features such as text input, push-to-talk, display of agent responses, and on-demand agent discovery.
-   **Foundation for Future Phases**: Establish a solid frontend architecture that can be extended in subsequent phases (e.g., authentication, advanced agent interactions).

## 3. Target Users

-   Developers learning/using the agent framework.
-   End-users interacting with the deployed agent ecosystem for various tasks.
-   Stakeholders evaluating the capabilities of the agent framework.

## 4. Features

### 4.1. Orchestrator Chat Interface
    -   **Description**: A responsive, single-page application where users interact with the Orchestrator agent via a chat interface.
    -   **Requirements**:
        -   Display a chronological thread of messages (user inputs and agent responses).
        -   Provide a clear text input field for users to type queries to the Orchestrator.
        -   Messages from different agents should be visually distinguishable (e.g., with an agent avatar or name).
        -   Support for basic markdown rendering in agent responses (e.g., bold, italics, lists, code blocks).
        -   The interface must be built using Ionic and Vue 3 components.
        -   The UI must be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    -   **User Stories**:
        -   As a user, I want to type my request into a chat input so I can communicate with the Orchestrator.
        -   As a user, I want to see my messages and the agent's responses in a clear, threaded view so I can follow the conversation.
        -   As a user, I want to easily identify which agent provided a response.

### 4.2. Push-to-Talk (PTT) Input
    -   **Description**: Allow users to input queries using their voice.
    -   **Requirements**:
        -   A clear button/icon to activate PTT.
        -   Leverage browser-based Speech-to-Text (STT) APIs for web.
        -   Investigate and implement STT using Ionic/Capacitor plugins for native mobile capabilities (if feasible within scope, otherwise plan for future enhancement).
        -   Transcribed text should populate the chat input field.
        -   Visual feedback during recording and processing.
    -   **User Stories**:
        -   As a user, I want to tap a button and speak my request so I don't have to type.
        -   As a user, I want to see that the system is listening when I use PTT.

### 4.3. On-Demand Agent Discovery
    -   **Description**: Users can ask the Orchestrator to list available agents or their capabilities.
    -   **Requirements**:
        -   The list of agents should not be visible by default.
        -   Users can ask "What agents are available?" or "What can you do?" to trigger the display of agent information.
        -   Agent information (name, brief description) should be presented cleanly within the chat interface.
    -   **User Stories**:
        -   As a user, I want to ask the orchestrator what agents it can work with so I understand its capabilities.

### 4.4. Agent Response Visualization
    -   **Description**: Clearly attribute responses to the originating agent.
    -   **Requirements**:
        -   Each message from an agent should clearly indicate the agent's name (e.g., "Metrics Agent says: ...").
        -   Consider using small icons or avatars associated with each agent for better visual distinction.
    -   **User Stories**: (Covered under 4.1)

### 4.5. Mobile Build Foundation (Ionic/Capacitor)
    -   **Description**: Ensure the project is structured to facilitate compilation into a native mobile app.
    -   **Requirements**:
        -   Use Ionic framework conventions and components.
        -   Set up the project with Capacitor for native access and build capabilities.
        -   Initial testing focused on web deployment, with a plan for iOS compilation.
        -   Address any mobile-specific UI/UX considerations (e.g., touch targets, navigation).
    -   **User Stories**:
        -   As a developer, I want the project to be easily buildable for iOS so we can deploy a native app.
        -   As a mobile user, I want the app to feel native and be easy to navigate on my device.

## 5. Design and UX Considerations

-   **Clarity**: The interface should be self-explanatory.
-   **Simplicity**: Avoid clutter. Focus on the core chat interaction.
-   **Responsiveness**: Ensure a good experience on all target devices.
-   **Accessibility**: Follow basic accessibility guidelines (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation).
-   **Performance**: The application should be fast and responsive.

## 6. Technical Considerations

-   **Frameworks**: Ionic 7+ with Vue 3 (Composition API).
-   **State Management**: Pinia (as per `003-vue-frontend-guidelines`).
-   **Routing**: Vue Router.
-   **API Interaction**: Use `axios` or `fetch` for communication with the FastAPI backend.
-   **Build Tools**: Vite.
-   **Native Compilation**: Capacitor.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

-   **Usability**: The application must be intuitive and easy to use.
-   **Performance**: UI interactions should be smooth, and data loading should be efficient.
-   **Maintainability**: Code should be well-structured, commented, and follow Vue/Ionic best practices.
-   **Scalability**: The frontend architecture should allow for the addition of new features and agent interactions in the future.

## 8. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Phase III)

-   Advanced PTT (offline, custom models).
-   **Full native PTT integration using a Capacitor plugin** (e.g., `@capacitor-community/speech-recognition` â€“ initial research done, web-based PTT implemented, native part deferred).
-   User accounts and authentication (Phase 5).
-   Rich media in chat (images, files).
-   Persistent chat history across sessions.
-   Detailed agent profile views.
-   UI for agent feedback (Phase 6).

## 9. Success Metrics

-   Successful implementation of all features listed in section 4.
-   Positive feedback from initial user testing regarding usability and clarity.
-   The web application is fully functional and responsive.
-   A basic iOS build can be successfully compiled and run on a simulator/device.
